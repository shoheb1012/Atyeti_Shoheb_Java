🔸 Problem 2: Game Score Tracker with Global, Local, and Final Variables
📝 Requirements:
Create a class GameTracker with:
Instance Variables: playerName, score, level
final int MAX_LEVEL = 10;
Methods:
increaseScore(int score) – Increase player’s score
levelUp() – Increment level, prevent exceeding MAX_LEVEL
resetGame() – Reset score and level to 0
Inside increaseScore(), declare a local variable named score to demonstrate shadowing.
Print both the local and global score values using this.score and score.
🧠 Concepts Covered:
Local vs global (instance) variables
Use of final for constants
Variable shadowing
Scope resolution with this
Safe updates within limits (MAX_LEVEL)
