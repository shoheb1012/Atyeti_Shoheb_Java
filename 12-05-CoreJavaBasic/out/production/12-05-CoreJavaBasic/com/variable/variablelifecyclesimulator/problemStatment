Absolutely Shoheb! Let's step it up to a truly deep-level Java problem focused exclusively on variable-related concepts. The following complex problem is designed to push your understanding of:

* Variable scope (instance, static, local)
* Shadowing
* Final variables
* Type casting and promotion
* Variable initialization order
* Default values
* Static blocks and instance blocks
* Class-level vs method-level variable lifecycles
* Mutability vs immutability

üß† Hardcore Problem Statement: Variable Lifecycle Simulator in a Multi-Class Java System

Build a Java program that simulates a virtual machine that tracks the lifecycle of all variables in a simulation of a "mission". The mission consists of multiple "Steps", each with its own variables, timers, and configuration constants.

Your task:

1. Create three Java classes: MissionController, Step, and Config.

2. Config.java:

   * Contains final static constants (like MAX\_STEPS = 10, DEFAULT\_TIMEOUT = 1000).
   * Introduce a static block that prints the variable values when the class is loaded.
   * Include a static final variable that's initialized with a method call.

3. Step.java:

   * Has instance variables: stepId (int), status (String), startTime (long), timeout (int).
   * Has static variables: totalStepsCreated (int).
   * Demonstrate variable shadowing using a method like void updateStatus(String status).
   * Use an instance initializer block to modify instance variables on object creation.
   * Include logic that shows the impact of not initializing a local variable.

4. MissionController.java:

   * Has a main() method.
   * Initialize and run 5 Step objects.
   * Track:

     * total number of steps created
     * step-specific timeouts (show difference between instance and static)
     * memory usage-like simulation using primitive and wrapper variables
   * Use nested blocks to demonstrate variable scope limitations.
   * Inside loops or conditionals, define and shadow variables of the same name as outer scopes and print the values to demonstrate visibility.

üéØ Expected Concepts to Explore

* Static vs instance variables and their lifecycle
* Static blocks vs instance initializer blocks
* Variable scope within nested blocks and methods
* Shadowing and hiding
* Final variables: initialization and immutability
* Type casting: e.g., simulate resource usage with byte, short, int, long
* Wrapper types vs primitive types in memory simulation
* What happens when you declare but don‚Äôt initialize a local variable?
* Default values of instance variables vs local variables

üîç Bonus Twist:

Create a debug method that uses reflection to print all variables of a Step object including their type, value, and scope.
