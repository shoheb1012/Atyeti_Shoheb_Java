Perfect, Shoheb! Here's a **clear, upgraded, and comprehensive problem statement** for your **Hotel Room Booking System**, including all the **bonus enhancements *. This version is powerful enough to show strong OOPs knowledge and is perfect for showcasing in interviews or your portfolio.

## 🏨 **Advanced Hotel Room Booking System — OOPs Project**

### 🎯 **Problem Statement:**

Design and implement an **Advanced Hotel Room Booking System** using Object-Oriented Programming in Java. The system should support **multiple room types**, allow **customer bookings**, handle **checkouts**, apply **custom billing rules**, and provide **admin-level features** like adding/updating rooms. The system must apply core OOPs principles such as **abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, composition**, and **enum-based design**.

### 🧩 **Core Functional Requirements:**

#### 1. **Room Management**

* Three room types: `DeluxeRoom`, `SuiteRoom`, `StandardRoom`
* Each room has:

  * Room Number (unique)
  * Room Type (`enum`)
  * AC/Non-AC (`boolean`)
  * Occupancy Status (Available/Booked — use `enum`)
  * Price per night

#### 2. **Booking and Checkout**

* A customer can:

  * View available rooms
  * Book a room (enter name, mobile, days of stay)
  * Checkout from room
* System calculates bill based on:

  * Base rate
  * Service tax (12%)
  * AC surcharge (if applicable)
  * Discounts for long stays (>5 days)

#### 3. **Customer Handling**

* Each customer has:

  * Unique Customer ID
  * Name
  * Mobile Number
  * Check-in and Check-out dates (use `LocalDate`)
  * Assigned Room (composition)
* System tracks which customer is in which room.

#### 4. **Admin Panel**

* Add new rooms
* Update price or room details
* View all rooms (with their status)
* View customer details for occupied rooms

#### 5. **Enums**

* Use enums for:

  * `RoomType` (DELUXE, SUITE, STANDARD)
  * `OccupancyStatus` (AVAILABLE, OCCUPIED)

### 💡 **OOP Concepts to Demonstrate:**

| Concept                 | Where It’s Used                                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Encapsulation           | Private fields with getters/setters                      |
| Abstraction             | `Room` is an abstract class                              |
| Inheritance             | `DeluxeRoom`, `SuiteRoom`, `StandardRoom` inherit `Room` |
| Polymorphism            | Overriding `calculateBill()` in each room type           |
| Composition             | `Customer` has-a `Room`; `Hotel` has-a list of Rooms     |
| Constructor Overloading | In `Room` or `Customer` for multiple initialization ways |
| Enums                   | For Room type and occupancy status                       |
| Exception Handling      | Invalid inputs, full room booking, duplicate room number |
| Collections             | Use of `ArrayList`, `HashMap` to manage rooms/customers  |
| Java Time API           | `LocalDate` for date management                          |

### 🧪 **Sample Scenarios:**

#### Booking

```
Enter your name: Shoheb Pathan
Mobile Number: 9876543210
Select Room Number to Book: 101
Enter Stay Duration (in days): 6

Room 101 (DeluxeRoom - AC) booked successfully!
Service Tax: ₹360.0
AC Surcharge: ₹150.0
Long Stay Discount: ₹300.0
Total Bill: ₹7710.0
```

#### Admin

```
--- Admin Panel ---
1. Add New Room
2. Update Room Price
3. View All Rooms
4. View Customer Details
```

---

### ✅ **Deliverables**:

* Java classes for: `Room`, `DeluxeRoom`, `SuiteRoom`, `StandardRoom`, `Customer`, `Hotel`, `AdminPanel`
* Enums: `RoomType`, `OccupancyStatus`
* Main class with menu-driven logic
* Console-based interface
