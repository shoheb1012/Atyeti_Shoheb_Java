Scenario:
You are given a large server log file (logs.txt) where each line contains a timestamp, user ID, and an action performed (e.g., LOGIN, LOGOUT, DOWNLOAD). The file size can be several GBs.
Task:
Parse the log file efficiently using Java I/O streams.
Calculate and output the total number of unique users who performed each action.
Find the user who performed the maximum number of DOWNLOAD actions.
Implement the solution with minimal memory footprint.
Key concepts: File handling, Streams, Collections (HashMap, HashSet), memory efficiency
