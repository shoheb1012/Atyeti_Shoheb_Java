5. Deadlock Simulation and Resolution
Problem:
Create a program that simulates a deadlock:
Two threads each lock two resources in opposite order.
Threads wait indefinitely causing deadlock.
Then fix the code to avoid deadlock using proper locking strategy.
Requirements:
Use synchronized blocks for locking.
Show the deadlock happening (program freezes).
Implement a solution like lock ordering or tryLock() with timeout.
