4. Custom Thread Pool Implementation
Problem:
Implement your own thread pool class with the following:
Fixed number of worker threads.
Task queue for holding submitted tasks.
Worker threads pick tasks from the queue and execute them.
Implement methods to submit tasks and shut down the pool gracefully.
Requirements:
Use Runnable tasks.
Use wait() and notify() or concurrent queues for task management.
Handle thread termination properly.
Expected Behavior:
Tasks are executed by worker threads.
Thread pool reuses threads efficiently.
No new tasks accepted after shutdown.
