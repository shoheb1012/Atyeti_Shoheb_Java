3. Print Numbers in Sequence Using Two Threads
Problem:
Create two threads: one prints odd numbers and the other prints even numbers from 1 to N, but the output must be strictly sequential (1, 2, 3, 4, ..., N).
Requirements:
Use thread coordination techniques like wait()/notify() or Lock and Condition.
Threads must alternate printing numbers in order.
Expected Behavior:
Output is numbers from 1 to N printed in order.
Odd and even threads take turns printing.
