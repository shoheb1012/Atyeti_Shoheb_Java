2. Producer-Consumer Problem
Problem:
Implement the classic producer-consumer scenario using Java threads.
Producer thread(s) generate data and put it into a shared buffer.
Consumer thread(s) take data from the buffer and process it.
The buffer has limited capacity.
Synchronize access using wait() and notify().
Requirements:
Use a fixed-size queue as the buffer.
Producer should wait if the buffer is full.
Consumer should wait if the buffer is empty.
Both should notify each other when they add/remove items.
Expected Behavior:
Producers and consumers work concurrently without data loss or corruption.
Program runs indefinitely or for a fixed number of produced items.
