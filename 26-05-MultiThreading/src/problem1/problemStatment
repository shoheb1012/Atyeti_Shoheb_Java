1. Multi-threaded Counter with Synchronization
Problem:
Write a Java program where multiple threads increment a shared integer counter 1000 times each. The program should create N threads (user-defined), each performing increments on the same counter.
Requirements:
Use a shared integer variable to hold the counter.
Synchronize the increment operation to avoid race conditions.
After all threads finish, print the final value of the counter.
Final value should be N * 1000.
Expected Behavior:
Without synchronization, the final count will be less than expected due to race conditions.
With synchronization (e.g., using synchronized block or AtomicInteger), the final count must be accurate.
