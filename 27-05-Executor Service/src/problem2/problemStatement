2. Callable and Future to Compute Results
Problem:
Write a program to calculate factorial of different numbers concurrently:
Create multiple Callable<Long> tasks, each computing factorial of a given number.
Submit them to an ExecutorService.
Use Future to get results asynchronously.
Print the factorial result for each number.
Requirements:
Use Callable interface for tasks returning results.
Handle possible exceptions.
Use Future.get() to retrieve results.
