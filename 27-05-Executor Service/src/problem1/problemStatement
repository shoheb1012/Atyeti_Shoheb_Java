1. Basic Executor Service with Fixed Thread Pool
Problem:
Create a program that:
Creates a fixed thread pool of size 3 using Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3).
Submits 10 tasks that print the current thread name and task number.
Shutdown the executor properly after tasks complete.
Requirements:
Use ExecutorService.submit(Runnable).
Tasks should run concurrently, but max 3 at a time.
Call shutdown() and wait for termination.
Expected Behavior:
Tasks print thread info.
Thread pool size remains constant at 3.
Program exits after all tasks complete.
